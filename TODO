TODO for supersaft:

* Max speed (bandwidth) [low]
* "Just send mode". A mode that just sends the file like nc (w/o proto) [low]
* Write a doc (and resume every time)


SERVER specific;

* FROM [mid]
  hier muss später mal ein kompletter authenfikations-mechanismus eingebaut 
	werden <- was überlegen! 

* resume files [mid]
* secure connection [low]
* share dirs for download [very low]


CLIENT specific;

* QUEUE [very low]
* recursiv [mid - high]
  ^^^^^^^^
	[zeank] todo this we would need something like astratis' makeflat, cause we
					don't want to allow subdirs in the spool, so we need a way to make
					sure that we don't get stuck in a name clash

* replace wget (((: HARHAR	include HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 1.0
